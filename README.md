# TapIt
A game coded by ChatGPT

Most of the code is unmodified, but I had to cherry-pick a few modifications once ChatGPT got confused about what features to include.

I didn't press ChatGPT too hard to complete the proposed design because it quickly loses track of things.

Initial prompt:
Propose a design for a simple but addictive mobile game 

Answer: 

Here is a proposal for a simple but addictive mobile game:

Title: "Tap It!"

Description: In this game, players tap on the screen to make a character jump and avoid obstacles. The character runs automatically, and the player's goal is to get as far as possible without crashing into an obstacle.

Game mechanics:

The character runs automatically at a constant speed.
The player can tap the screen to make the character jump.
Obstacles appear at random intervals and can be one of several types:
Low barriers that the character can jump over
High barriers that the character must duck under
Moving obstacles that the character must avoid by jumping or ducking
The character has a limited number of lives, and losing all lives ends the game.
Each time the character successfully avoids an obstacle, the player earns a point.
The game becomes progressively more difficult as the player progresses, with more and more obstacles appearing on the screen at once.
